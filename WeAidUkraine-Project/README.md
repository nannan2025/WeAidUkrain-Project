# WeAidUkraine

**WeAidUkraine** is an all-in-one web platform for Ukrainian citizens and refugees that helps them to connect with the nearest military units, telehealth services, and emergency SOS services. Our whole application has language translation options that will provide a convenient way to find the nearest resources such as food, water, and shelter to provide vital aid to the people during this difficult time. We  have also built a donation platform for humanitarian relief.

## 💡 Inspiration

When we heard about the disruption of daily life in Ukraine, I felt sad for the people living there. As students who are passionate about technology, we decided to create a project that can help as many people as possible. 


## ⭐Project introduction: 

**WeAidUkraine** - aims to help people facing problems in Ukraine. From our research, we understand people from Ukraine are suffering from losing their houses, and lack of food, or healthcare. Therefore, we created a project to address these problems: 

☛ In this WeAidUkraine project, we help people to **find the nearest food and shelter resources**. 

☛ We also let people from all over the world **donate** what they have to help Ukraine either in monetary or in the form of food and clothing. 

☛ One of the most outstanding features of our projects is providing **online healthcare** to people living in Ukraine, we directly connect people with doctors worldwide who are willing to help 24/7. 

☛ In case of emergency, we also help people by the **SOS** function.

☛ Additionally, people can also communicate with our team through our created **chatbot**. 
 
💘However, what makes our project special is that users can **translate the website into any language**. In our opinion, this is a powerful function because not all people understand English. 

## ⚙️ What it does

WeAidUkraine covers many different problems, we have a different approach for each issue: 

🔦People can find the **nearest location of food and housing by looking and filtering in the map**. The map is designed with provided database about available food and housing from all over the world. 

🔦People can **donate to Ukrain by submitting our form**. The form is directly connected to our team so we will receive donation information and start our process to pick up the donation based on the provided address. 

🔦We get the data of **volunteer doctors who can help people in Ukraine online**. There are many different doctor types and users can pick time slots to meet the doctors virtually. Volunteer doctors’ information is provided in detail and is reliable. 

🔦The **SOS button** will lead people to Whatsapp of an organization in Ukraine. This organization can then help people because they are local-based. 

🔦Our **chatbot** was built with the function to get information and needs from people for further help. 

## 🔧 How we built it

- We designed a website using **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.** 

- We had also applied **Google Cloud** to create a chatbot using **Dialogflow** .The data received from the user will be stored in the database in real-time.

- We used **Google Maps API** to customize the resources map and pin the location that is useful for the users. 

For further development, we hope to have more databases added to our website so that people can have more resources near them. 

## ⭐ How will our project be used?

We strongly believe that WeAidUkraine will be helpful for both people within and outside Ukraine. On the one hand, by using our project people in Ukraine can have more information and help from the world so that they can stay safe during their hardship. On the other hand, our website keeps people from all over the world updated on what is happening in Ukraine and also allows them to help people in Ukraine as much as they can. 

## Challenges we ran into 🙁

There are many different challenges that we ran into while developing our website: 

❌ Finding a database for resources. We spent days finding data from Ukraine’s website and also from other countries to have sufficient information. 

❌ The translate function. It is new to us and we had to learn how to do it. We have a hard time at first because the instructions from the internet do not work. However, we were flexible enough to get the function works on our website. 

❌Time management, as there is a lot of research involved in this project. 

❌Members of the team are also at different time zone, so we also need to come up with a schedule and responsibility that works for all time zone.

## ⭐ How will our project be available to the public? What is our plan to scale our project?

📟We made our website accessible for all people and also have the translate function so we strongly believe that the project can be used by all people who need help and are willing to help. What we want to focus on most is building a community that can provide help and asks for help when needed. 

📟Our big goals moving forward consist of collecting more data, partnering with charitable organizations, and building relationships with hospitals to have more volunteer doctors.
